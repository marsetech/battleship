# Project History

## Origins

This project originated as a **university coursework assignment**, developed within an academic context with the primary goal of applying theoretical concepts through practical implementation.
At its inception, the focus was on correctness, learning outcomes, and experimentation rather than long-term maintainability or public distribution.

The initial codebase reflected typical characteristics of academic projects:
- Rapid prototyping
- Limited documentation
- Mixed language usage
- Minimal concern for extensibility or community standards

Despite these constraints, the project established a solid functional and architectural foundation.

## Evolution

Over time, the project demonstrated potential beyond its original academic scope.
As a result, it entered a **progressive refactoring and reorganization phase**, aimed at transforming it into a professional-grade GitHub repository.

This evolution includes:
- Gradual **standardization of the project structure**
- Progressive **alignment with industry best practices**
- Introduction of **clear architectural boundaries**
- Adoption of **version control conventions** suitable for collaborative development

## Language and Documentation Unification

A key step in the transition has been the **unification of language and terminology** across the entire codebase and documentation.

Specifically:
- Internal comments, documentation, and public-facing materials are being progressively converted to **English**
- Naming conventions are being standardized to improve clarity and consistency
- Documentation files (e.g. `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`) are introduced or expanded to reflect professional expectations

This process is intentionally incremental, ensuring stability while improving readability and accessibility.

## Transition to a Professional GitHub Project

The long-term objective is to present this repository as a **fully professional GitHub project**, independent of its academic origins.

Planned and ongoing improvements include:
- Clear separation between source code, configuration, and build artifacts
- Reproducible build processes
- Explicit documentation of design decisions
- Improved modularity and testability
- GitHub-oriented workflows (CI, code ownership, contribution guidelines)

While the academic roots remain an important part of the project’s identity, they now serve as a **starting point rather than a limitation**.

## Current Status

At its current stage, the project is in an **active transition phase**:
- Functional completeness is preserved
- Structural and stylistic refinements are ongoing
- The repository is being shaped for long-term maintainability and potential collaboration

This history reflects a deliberate and transparent evolution—from a university assignment to a professionally structured software project.
